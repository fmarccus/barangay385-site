                    <p>Barangay is the smallest political administrative unit in the Philippines. Also considered as
                        the
                        fundamental base of the countryâ€™s national government.
                        It represents the government at the very basic level and acts as the first help of the
                        people.
                        It is
                        where the community's programs, projects, and initiatives are conceptualized. To add, the
                        barangay
                        offices are responsible for the processing and providing of forms such for indigency,
                        business
                        permits,
                        as well as propagation of news by and to its constituents.
                        It was found out that most of the barangay officials own a personal computer at home and in
                        the
                        office. </p>
                    <p>
                        It was discovered that the respondents are proficient in computer usage. It is crucial that
                        barangay
                        officials use technologies in disseminating or receiving information for productivity.
                        Data is therefore essential for making wise decisions. Each barangay must keep a database
                        containing
                        several pieces of information about the barangay, including its population, financial
                        transaction
                        records, complaints lodged, houses built in the neighborhood, and socioeconomic profiles of
                        its
                        residents.</p>

                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Barangay 385 is a barangay located in Manila. It is under the district III district of Quiapo. It
                        is
                        situated in 14.5958, 210.9875 in the island of Luzon. It shares common border with the Barangay
                        383,
                        384, 393, 387, and 386. Its population in 2022 is approximately 3000 people and the registered
                        voters are around 1000.</p>
                    <p>
                        As per the Barangay secretary, household profiling is performed manually. There are people
                        assigned
                        to visit residents from house-to-house and fill in a physical form and those data inside the
                        forms
                        are then physically counted. In terms of requesting clearances and certificates, logbooks are
                        used
                        to keep track of the records.</p>

                    <p>There is a person-in-charge of noting the requesters of the
                        clearances. In addition, the said Barangay lacks an updates/announcements platform thus relies
                        on
                        posting signboards or printed papers outside the barangay hall.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>In general, the proposed project aims to streamline the process of household profiling,
                        generation
                        of forms or certificates, visualization of local statistics, and building an official website
                        for
                        Barangay 385.
                        The significance of the study lies in providing the said barangay with technology that can aid
                        the
                        barangay in policy and decision-making, provision of social services, distribution of financial
                        aid
                        and services to the constituents using the integrated analytics module, as well as propagation
                        of
                        news and updates.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Data and information gathering, as well as the system to be developed is only delimited to
                        Barangay
                        385, Manila. The main data collection method will be via Internet for related literature and
                        other
                        references and onsite or through phone interview for coordinating with the Barangay 385
                        representatives or officials.</p>
                    <p>
                        As this is a web-based application, it can only be accessed using a desktop computer, laptop,
                        and
                        mobile phone if the device itself has the latest iteration of a browser application as well as
                        consistent Internet access.</p>
                    <p>
                        The system must be evaluated using ISO/IEC 25010 in terms of <span
